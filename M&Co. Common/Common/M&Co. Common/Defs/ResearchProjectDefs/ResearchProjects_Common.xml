    <label>M&amp;Co.: energy pack</label>
    <description>   Experiment with the fix batteries to develop a mobile power supply.

- Develop an energy pack. It is used to power mobile devices.
    </description>
    <descriptionDiscovered>   You have developped a new battery type that can be moved as an energy pack once fully loaded.

- You can now make energy packs.
- Energy pack must be linked to your power net to charge up. They will be usable once fully loaded.

		<description>   After eletrocuting himself while trying to repair a short-circuited battery under rain, one of your colonist had the idea to develop an electronic protection module.

- Develop some electronic components to produce integrated electronics board.
    </description>
    <descriptionDiscovered>   Your researchers have developped several basic eletronic components. Combined together by a crafty man, they will form integrated circuits boards.

- You can now build an electronic workbench.
- You can now make integrated circuits boards at the electronic workbench.
