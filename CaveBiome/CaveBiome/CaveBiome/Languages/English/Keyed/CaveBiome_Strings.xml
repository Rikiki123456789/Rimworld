  <CaveBiome.CavePlants>In caves, most cave plants can be useful so look around!\n- some plants like giant leafs can be cooked,\n- others like cave vine are hard enough to be used like wood,\n- and some like devil's tongue provide useful fibrous material.\n\nBeware, though! Caves are a hard place to live and some plants may be dangerous.</CaveBiome.CavePlants>

  <CaveBiome.GrowingInCave>The sun cannot directly light the cave tunnels. You can however grow some plants in cave wells. Cave wells are natural openings to the surface.</CaveBiome.GrowingInCave>
