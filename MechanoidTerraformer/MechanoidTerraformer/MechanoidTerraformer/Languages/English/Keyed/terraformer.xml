<studyreport>### Study report ###\n\nStudy subject: strange mechanoid artifact\n\n- Artifact location: </studyreport>
<observation>\n- Observations:\n  1. the artifact has deployed underground foundations.\n  2. some pylons have been erected near the main structure.\n  3. the artifact seems to generate powerful artificial thunderstorms.\n\n- Deductions:\n  1. this device appears to be a mechanoid terraformer.\n  2. its purpose is to re-shape the surface of this planet to prepare a large-scale invasion.\n\n- Recommandations:\n  1. proceed with *extreme* caution when attempting anything on the artifact!\n  2. deactivating the onboard beacon should be a priority to avoid future invasion.\n  3. consider re-routing the power generated during artificial thunderstorms.\n  4. further research may allow us to take advantage of those artificial thunderstorms.\n</observation>

<attack>   Attacking the artifact seems to be a bad idea. You have detected some sort of emergency call sent from it.\nWhatever it is, this does not sound good at all...</attack>
<Invasion>Invasion</Invasion>
<Before_extraction>   Before its extraction, the mechanoid terraformer AI core controller somehow detected your attempts at shutting it down.\nIt had enough time to emit an emergency call. Be prepared to welcome the incoming terrafomer defending force.</Before_extraction>

<success_extract>   You have successfully extracted the weather controller from the mechanoid terraformer.\n\nYou can now build your own one to unleash the sky's wrath on your ennemies.</success_extract>

<success_reroute>   You have successfully rerouted the power network of the mechanoid terraformer.\n\nRemember that you need some batteries to stock the brief surges of energy generated by the thunderstorms.</success_reroute>
<invaders>   Beware! The mechanoid invasion has begun. This world will soon become a new mechanoid hive!</invaders>
<strange_thing>   You have detected a strange thing falling from the sky. It is quite bigger than a drop pod and does not emit the standard trading federation emergency call.\nYou should send someone to scout it but be careful, this stinks mechanoid technology...</strange_thing>
